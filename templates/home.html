<h1>
  Visualization of Microbial Ecosystem Data
</h1>
<h2>
  A Website for displaying microbial data.
</h2>

<p>
  The microbiome - a community of different microbes living in one ecosystem - has a vast impact on the human life. Not only that a human's health partly relies on those microbiomes but also e.g. how well food is digested in our stomach.<br>
As already mentioned, this refers to a community of microbes that interact with each and which are perfectly coordinated within each other.<br>
In order to now understand the way these communities behave, scientists all over the world try to identify the composition of all different microbiomes that can be found in the human body.<br>
</p>
<p>
This website was created in order to visualize microbial data. Not only that, we make it possible to give you a great overview over the metadata of your samples but we also provide an easy way to visualize the overall compound of the microbes that were found within the ecosystem.
