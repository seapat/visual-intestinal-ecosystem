## About the course

cited from the course descritpion:

"The goal of this lecture is that you will learn to understand the visual analysis process and know basic methods of information visualization, including the "do's" and
"don'ts" of visualization. You will know methods to visualize diverse biological data like genomics or transcriptomics data and you will be able to chose suitable visualizations based on the type of data and the given analysis task. In the exercises, you will learn how to design and develop complex, interactive visual analytics applications in small teams."

## Goals
